# gameDevCourseProj1
First project for gamedev course

Project has the same functions as the project on the slides.
ALSO contains Quality-Of-Life elements--i.e. control hints and 
tips--and a coding style that I use for my own projects that 
implements all necessary features for this project--i.e. using
"return gates" in place of if-else statements.

Sphere is also constrained within set movement bounds to avoid
it going beyond camera's field of view.
